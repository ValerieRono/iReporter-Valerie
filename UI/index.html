                    Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and
                    localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables
                    any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the
                    general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention
